attachFood to layers
	

if (!attached food to layers)
	if (selected)
		show selected
	else if (active)
		show active
	else if (inactive AND show inactive foods)
		show disabled
	else
		hide

		
else (attached food to layers)
	if (layer is hidden)
		Food is hidden unless selected
	if (layer is disabled)
		Food is disabled unless selected
	else	
		Food is normal
			
Always draw all food on top of the layers, even if attached to layers



I have to sort lines and items by active/drawOrder

Layers only modify visibility
